More filtering of data from the user
	Data from the user - such as their user id and permitted actions is not trusted, but the data they submit isn't really filtered; the usernames/passwords/problem name/etc. is not necessarily being forced to be a string, the user's submission file is not checked for size (they could be uploading a 1GB file and filling up the server's disk)

Add everything for submitting/answering clarifications
Rejudge submissions
	Ability for the admins/judges to compare the output from the user's programs to the expected output for the problem and to manually judge it/mark it correct
	Ability to be able to ask the system to automatically rerun the submissions and them for correctness - useful if an error is discovered in the input or expected output files which do not fit the problem specification
Submissions
	add row to submissions on problem submit
Better/more logging
Better/more usable web layout
Support for submitting solutions in more languages (Currently only supports Java)
Add an administration page to allow the admin to:
	Start/stop the contest at will
	Set start and stop times to automatically open the contest
	Manage multiple contests:
		Have one contest for practice then another for the actual competition and easily switch the active contest
		Have the ability to have multiple contests running at the same time, allowing there to be multiple categories of users, each part of a different contest, or even have users be part of multiple groups so that they are able to submit problems to more than one competition at a time
	Various other settings for the behavior of the server/contest
Adding the use of WebSockets to the page so the user does not need to refresh it in order to see updates for things like the scoreboard, clarifications, and contest state (started/stopped/countdown)
	Make it so that the user is not waiting on the server to respond when submitting a solution
Clock for timed competition showing time until start/time remaining
